# Vityamod
Vityamod is a mod for WEBFISHING inspired by MegaHack by Absolute. It provides neat, fun and useful features that does not involve anything exploitive or potentially harmful for other players.
The goal of this mod is to deliver a mod menu that provides help on stuff you can't do in the unmodded WEBFISHING client, while keeping it safe from potentially harming the game experience. <br><br>
