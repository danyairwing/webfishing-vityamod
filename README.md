# Vityamod

Vityamod is a mod for WEBFISHING inspired by [Mega Hack by Absolute](https://youtu.be/_fgQr0SSIys). It provides neat, fun and useful features that does not involve anything exploitive or potentially harmful for other players.
The goal of this mod is to deliver a mod menu that provides help on stuff you can't do in the unmodded WEBFISHING client, while keeping it safe from potentially harming the game experience. <br><br>

# FAQ
Q: Can this be specified as hacking menu? <br>
A: The goal of Vityamod is to provide handy, customizable and fun features. Vityamod is not going to contain features that break the game. <s>(although its possible to break the game in the nastiest ways possible)</s> <br>
Q: Can I contribute? <br>
A: You can, but I don't recommend it. I'm working single-handedly on this project and trying to keep everything as I vision it. The current codebase, to say the least, is unorganized. In future releases this will be fixed. <br>
